# Project 4 XGO Wave Hand

## Ⅰ. Teaching Aims

1. Recognize the three joints of **Upper / Middle / Lower**, and focus on the combined control of Middle and Lower.
2. While sitting, wave the claw three times by `repeat`.
3. After the action is completed, play a beeping sound as multimodal feedback.
4. Understand the importance of  `XGO reset pose` for clearing cumulative errors.



## Ⅱ. Pre-class Check

- XGO + Foxbit + MicroBlocks IDE.
- XGO battery power ≥ 60 %. 
- MicroBlocks status bar shows a green dot, and the development board model is **Foxbit**.
- Test `XGO init` and `XGO reset pose`.
- Leave a gap in front of the desktop to prevent the claw from hitting objects.

## Ⅳ. Test: Waving While Sitting

1. Drag in the initialization block: `when started → XGO init → XGO reset pose → XGO action Sit Down`  
2. Piece the main action logic as shown:

3. Click ▶Run, and the dog will “wave while sitting × 3” and then reset.

## Ⅴ. Quiz

1. Why must `Sit Down` first and then wave the claw?
2. What will happen if the Lower joint is not reset to 0° and this cycle is repeated many times?
3. How to change “wave once” into a `waveOnce()` custom Block, and then call it by `repeat`?



## Ⅵ. FAQ

| Questions          | Possible causes               | Solutions                     |
|------|----------|----------|
| Sit down but do not wave | `repeat` is empty or omits joint instructions inside | Check the loop content |
| The amplitude is too small | Middle° is too low | Set up to 25–35° |
| “wrist” is not bent | Lower° = 0° | set 8–12° |
| The servo is shaking/screaming | The angle exceeds the limit or touches the table | Reduce the angle and remove the obstacle |
| The second and third movements are deformed | There is a lack of reset within the loop | After each waving, set Middle, Lower = 0° |
| The program ends in a strange posture | Forgot `XGO reset pose` | Add it before the end |

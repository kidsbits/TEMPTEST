# Project 1 Hello XGO

## Ⅰ. Teaching Aims

1. Verify whether the communication between MicroBlocks and XGO-lite is normal and complete the power-on initialization.
2. Recognize and be able to use the three most basic “system blocks”.
3. Be able to invoke 1 ~ N built-in actions and insert appropriate waiting times based on their duration.
4. Understand the role of   `XGO reset pose` in the “posture baseline” to pave the way for follow-up experiments.

## Ⅱ. Pre-class Check

- XGO + Foxbit + MicroBlocks IDE.
- XGO battery power ≥ 60 %. 
- MicroBlocks status bar shows a green dot, and the development board model is **Foxbit**.
- In Library → Robot, tick **XGO-lite**. If there are no XGO blocks, please restart the software or reload the extension.

## Ⅳ. Practice

1. Open a blank script in the workspace.
2. Drag in and assemble the following blocks:

   ![Img](../media/scriptImage2385183.png)

3. Click on the green ▶ above the workspace, and the XGO will sit down slowly.

## Ⅴ. Test 1: A Single “Sit Down → Stand Up” Loop

Objective: Perform “Stand Up → Sit Down → Stand Up”.

The waiting time (`waitMillis`) can be fine-tuned by 600 ~ 1200 ms according to the actual speed of the servo.

## Ⅵ. Test 2: “Sit Down - Stand Up - Sit Down” Loop

Based on test 1, we put on a `forever` loop and add one more “`Sit Down` and `Stand Up`”.

The end `XGO reset pose` prevents the servo from overheating due to prolonged bending.



## Ⅶ. Quiz

1. Why is it recommended to put `XGO init` in the first sentence of almost all scripts?
2. What phenomenon will occur if `waitMillis` is omitted and the next action is executed immediately after?
3. Both `XGO reset pose` and `Stand Up` can make robots stand upright. What is the essential difference between them?

|------|----------|----------|
| No action was responded, <br>and the serial port reported an error | Forgot `XGO init`, <br/>or USB is not connected. | Plug in the wire again, <br/>restart MicroBlocks, <br/>and add `XGO init` to the <br/>first line of the script |
| Got stuck during the movement | Low battery / The servo is <br/>blocked by the ground or cables | Charge until the battery power is ≥ 60%, <br/>and clear the surrounding obstacles |
| Cannot stand steadily after sitting down | Forgot `XGO reset pose` | Add a reset action at the end |
| “I²C busy” pops up <br/>when downloading the script | The old script is still running | First press “Stop”, <br/>and then download again |

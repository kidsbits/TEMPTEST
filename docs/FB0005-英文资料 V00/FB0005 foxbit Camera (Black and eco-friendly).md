[TOC]



## Description

The fox:bit camera adopts the ESP32-S module and the OV2640 camera module. It can operate independently in minimum system and can be applied in various Internet of Things applications, such as home smart devices, industrial wireless control, wireless monitoring, QR code recognition, wireless positioning system signals. It also supports secondary development and various Internet of Things device applications.

## Connection & Environment Configuration

**Arduino IDE (Windows)**

Arduino official: https://www.arduino.cc/

Download the latest version of the arduino. After entering the website，as shown below:

There are many versions of Arduino, including those for Windows,mac and linux systems, as well as older ones.You just need to download a version that suits your system.

![19](./media/19.png)

Here, we take the Windows system as an example to introduce the steps of downloading and installing. There are also two versions of the Windows system: one for installation, one for download(no need to install and just unzip it to use).

Click JUST DOWNLOAD.

**Environment Configuration**

Step 1: Connect the computer to the fox:bit camera via a Type-C data cable;

Step 2: Insert the camera and SD card into the SD card slot of the fox:bit camera;

Set up the test environment:
If you see ![21](./media/21.png) in the board types of the Arduino IDE, jump to Settings environment.

Configure esp32: Go to Arduino-->File-->Preferences + comma
Configure ESP url
Copy “https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json” to “Additional Board Manager URLs”.

## Sample Code

Ensure that the serial port and board model are correct.

![7](./media/7.png)

Select the sample code.

![8](./media/8.png)

Modify the camera type to esp32-cam.

Click ![11](./media/11.png) to compile and burn the code.

![12](./media/12.png)

If the IDE shows as shown below, it indicates that the test code has been uploaded successfully. After that, open the Serial monitor in the upper right corner of the Arduino.

**Test**

Set the baud rate to 11500 and remove the IO0 and GND lines. Press the reset button and the LED indicator will flash. If it is unable to connect to WiFi, please press the reset button again.

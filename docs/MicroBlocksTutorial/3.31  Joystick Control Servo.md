## 3.31.3 Test Code

You can manually build blocks, or directly open the code file we provide: `3-31-Joystick Control Servo.ubp`. If you have any questions about how to open code files or upload code, please back to `1.9 Upload Code`.

**Build code blocks:**

1. In ![](./media/control.png), drag ![](./media/t1.png) and ![](./media/t2.png) to the script area, and stack them together.

2. Determine whether the joystick is less than -90. If yes, the servo rotates to 180 degrees.
3. Determine whether the joystick is greater than 90. If yes, the servo rotates to 0 degrees.

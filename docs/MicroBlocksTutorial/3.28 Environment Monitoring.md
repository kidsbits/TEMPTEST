# 3.28 Environment Monitoring

## 3.28.1 Overview

In this project, we use an OLED display to reveal the values of temperature, humidity, air pressure and altitude in the environment. It can be regarded as a mini environmental monitoring device. 

## 3.28.2 Test Code

You can manually build blocks, or directly open the code file we provide: `3-28-Environment Monitoring.ubp`. If you have any questions about how to open code files or upload code, please back to `1.9 Upload Code`.

**Build code blocks:**

1. In ![](./media/control.png), drag ![](./media/t1.png) and ![](./media/t2.png) to the script area, and stack them together.

2. Before building blocks, ![t175](./media/t175.png) is required to clear all OLED display to prevent initial display content.
2. Add a ![t174](./media/t174.png) to show `Data Suggest` at the position of (X:25, Y:0). Turn the `big` off.
2. Add another ![t174](./media/t174.png) to show `T:` at the position of (X:0, Y:10) at the next line.
2. Show temperature value at the position of (X:20, Y:10) followed a `C` at (X:40, Y:10).
2. Similarly, build blocks to show humidity values and pressure values. Add a delay of 1 second and clear the OLED at last.

## 3.28.3 Test Result

Connect the coding box to the MicroBlocks via USB or Bluetooth, and click ![t59](./media/t59.png) to upload the code to the coding box. You will see the values of temperature, humidity, air pressure and altitude on the OLED display. These values refresh every second.

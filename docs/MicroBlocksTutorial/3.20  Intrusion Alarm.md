## 3.20.3 Test Code

You can manually build blocks, or directly open the code file we provide: `3-20-Intrusion Alarm.ubp`. If you have any questions about how to open code files or upload code, please back to `1.9 Upload Code`.

**Build code blocks:**

1. In ![](./media/control.png), drag ![](./media/t1.png) and ![](./media/t2.png) to the script area, and stack them together.

## 3.20.4 Test Result

Connect the coding box to the MicroBlocks via USB or Bluetooth, and click ![t59](./media/t59.png) to upload the code to the coding box. When the sensor detects a motion around, the speaker alarms, the red LED turns on and the green one is off. If no intrusion is detected, the red LED will go off and the green will be on; at the same time, the speaker stays quiet.

## 4. Driver & Development Environment

### 4.1 USB-to-serial Driver (CH340)

FoxBit is equipped with **CH340** chip. Before connecting to the computer for the first time, the corresponding driver must be installed; otherwise, the IDE will not recognize the serial port.

Please download a driver according to your system:

[https://docs.keyestudio.com/en/latest/docs/Download_Center/Download_Center.html#driver-download](https://docs.keyestudio.com/en/latest/docs/Download_Center/Download_Center.html#driver-download)



**Windows**  

1. Download `CH341SER.EXE`, and double-click to run and then【install】.
2. After that, restart the computer. The Device Manager should display **USB-SERIAL CH340 (COMx)**.

**macOS**  
1. For macOS 11+, it usually plug and play. If it cannot be recognized, download the  `CH34xVCPDriver.pkg` with the identification `macOS`.   
2. After installation, go to “System Settings ▸ privacy & security” to allow the driver to load and restart.
3. Terminal execute `ls /dev/cu.*` and you will see `/dev/cu.wchusbserialXXXX`. 

**Linux**

1. Most released versions come with built-in `ch341` modules, so `dmesg | grep ttyUSB` will show  `ttyUSB0`.

2. If it does not load automatically, run `sudo modprobe ch341` and check  `/dev/ttyUSB*` again.

3. After installation, please select the corresponding serial number (COMx / ttyUSBx / cu.wchusbserial) in MicroBlocks.

### 4.2 MicroBlocks IDE

1. Enter [https://microblocks.fun/download](https://microblocks.fun/download) to download an installation package suitable for the system. 
2. After installation, start the IDE. A gray indicator at the lower right corner indicates that it is not connected.
3. The FoxBit development board is connected to the computer via a Type-C cable.
4. Select **update firmware on board** in the drop-down box from the “Gear” at the top of Microblocks.
5. Select FoxBit and update the firmware. You need to wait for a few seconds.
6. After the firmware is updated, click 「Connect」 → select the corresponding serial port → OK. The appearance of a small green dot in the status bar indicates that it is connected. The model of the board is FoxBit, and its extension library is automatically displayed on the left side.



## 5. Typical Application Scenarios

1. **Internet of Things (IoT)** : Wi-Fi/BLE direct connection to the cloud, enabling smart home, environmental monitoring, and remote control.
2. **STEAM Education** : Integrating multiple sensors and combining with graphical programming, to help students quickly get started with hardware development.
3. **Intelligent Control** : Rich I/O and PWM, suitable for robots and automated equipment.
4. **DIY Creation** : RGB dot matrix + buzzer + IMU, capable of creating interactive lights, mini-games, etc.



## 6. FAQ

| Questions | Solutions |
|------|----------|
| IDE cannot find the board model | check the USB cable and CH340 driver, <br>or try another port or cable. |
| Report “I²C busy” when downloading script | The previous script occupied the bus; <br/>Click Stop and then download again |
| No responce on the LED matrix | Ensure that the power supply is sufficient <br/>and GPIO13 is not occupied by other functions |
| Cannot connect to Wi-Fi | It only supports 2.4GHz; <br/>Check the SSID/passwords to avoid Chinese spaces |

# Introduction to Coding Box

![a](./media/a.png)

## 1. Introduction

Based on ESP32, this coding box is a learning toolbox for children over 6 years old, as a shell wraps its circuit board, avoiding pins scratched children. 

The ESP32 coding box integrates 16 sensors and modules, including LED, button, 1.3 inch OLED display, photoresistor, sound sensor, speaker, temperature and humidity sensor as well as pressure sensor. Thus, the box can be matched with interesting experiments. In this tutorial, we provide 36 projects, like small lamp, automatic window, sound control light, compass, and environmental monitoring.

Each project contains three programming methods: MicroPython, KidsBlock Desktop graphical programming which only need to build up code blocks, and another online wireless graphical programming which is much easier. So this kit is helpful for the initial cultivation of programming thinking.

## 2. Features

**1. No wiring:** We integrate wiring in circuit board, so no worry about the wrong wiring to burn the module.

**2. Multiple functions:** With ESP32 development board as control board, this box contains 16 sensors and modules, and it is available to either external 7-12V DC power or 6 AA batteries.

**3. Simple structure:** Ready-to-use and full shell package prevents hands from being scratched by pins and protects the board as well.

**4. Strong expansibility:** Four RJ11 interfaces are reserved beyond the shell, all of which are compatible with IIC communication.

**5. Basic programming learning:** Graphical programming for new hands to cultivate programming logic and foundation; MicroPython programming for developers to contact the underlying codes combined with hardware.



## 3. Parameters

**Operating voltage:** 3.3v

**External DC power:** 7-12V

**Built-in battery holder:** 9V (six AA batteries, of 1.5V each)

**USB power:** 5V

**Operating temperature:** 0 °C ~ 50 °C

# 3.35 WiFi Real-time Display

## 3.35.1 Overview

In this project, we display the values of temperature and humidity sensor, pressure sensor, photoresistor, sound sensor, PIR motion sensor and ultrasonic sensor on the web page. 

## 3.35.2 Test Code

### 3.35.2.1  Build Code

There are two ways to upload the code: directly open the code file we provide; or manually build blocks.

**Directly open the code file we provide:**

1. Click ![](./media/j68.png) and choose `Load from your computer`

2. We have already downloaded the codes on computer desktop, so open the file and choose `3-35-wifiWebpageDisplay.sb3`

**Manually build blocks:**

1. Initialize BMP388 and wifi, set the name and passwords of wifi.

   Initialize OLED and display the IP address of the wifi on it.

### 3.35.2.2 Test Result

Upload the code, and the OLED shows the IP address after connecting to wifi. 

Connect your computer/mobile phone and ESP32 to the same wifi, and you can access the IP address to see the values through your device. 

If you are using a mobile phone hotspot, you can directly access the IP via the phone.

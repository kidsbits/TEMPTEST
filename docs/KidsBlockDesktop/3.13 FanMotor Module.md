# 3.13 Fan/Motor Module

## 3.13.1 Overview

The motor adopts HR1124S motor control chip that is a single channel H-bridge driver chip used in DC motors. The H-bridge drive uses PMOS and NMOS power tubes with low on-resistance, ensuring lower power loss and longer safe working time. In addition, its standby and static working current are both low, so it is commonly used in toys.

**Motor control logic table:**

| IO18 | IO17 |      motor state      |
| :--: | :--: | :-------------------: |
| HIGH | LOW  |    forward rotate     |
| LOW  | HIGH |    reverse rotate     |
| HIGH | HIGH | stop (a gradual stop) |
| LOW  | LOW  | brake (a brake stop)  |



## 3.13.3 Code Blocks

This block controls the rotation of the motor. You only need to set motor pins and output levels of the pins.

### 3.13.4.1 Build Code

There are two ways to upload the code: directly open the code file we provide; or manually build blocks.

**Directly open the code file we provide:**

1. Click ![](./media/j68.png) and choose `Load from your computer`

![](./media/j67.png)

2. We have already downloaded the codes on computer desktop, so open the file and choose `3-13-fan.sb3`

**Manually build blocks:**

1. In ![events](./media/events.png), find ![j1](./media/j1.png) block.
2. In ![control](./media/control.png), find and place ![j2](./media/j2.png) block under ![j1](./media/j1.png).

3. In ![motor](./media/motor.png), put ![6-13](./media/j44.png) into ![j2](./media/j2.png), and set pin IO17 to output `LOW` and pin IO18 to output `HIGH`.
4. Add a delay of 2S.

5. Duplicate the above code and modify pin IO17 to `HIGH` and IO18 to `LOW`.
6. Duplicate again and set both IO17 and IO18 to `LOW`.

### 3.13.4.2 Test Result

After uploading code, you will see the fan forward rotates for 2s and then reverses for another 2s. Then it stops. These actions repeat.

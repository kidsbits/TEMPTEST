# KidsBlock Desktop Tutorial

## 1. KidsBlock Desktop Graphical Programming

KidsBlock Desktop is a graphical programming tool designed to help children and beginners learn programming. It uses a visual programming interface to build programs by dragging code blocks rather than writing codes directly. This is especially suitable for users without programming background, as it simplifies the process and lowers the learning threshold.

**Main Features:**

1. **Graphical interface**: Users create programs by dragging code blocks with different functions (such as loops, conditional judgments, variables, etc.), rather than learning complex code syntax issues. 
2. **Educational orientation**: It is designed for children and teens with a user-friendly interface, and it helps them learn programming thinking and logic in fun.
3. **Interactive learning**: Through graphical programming, children see how the programs they write process and respond in real time, increasing the joy and interactivity.
4. **Diversified functional blocks**: It provides a wealth of blocks for the creation of different types of programs and projects, including simple animations, games and gadgets.
5. **Easy to expand**: Some versions of KidsBlock are able to extend the functionality through custom modules or plug-ins, thus providing more programming possibilities.

With graphical programming, KidsBlock Desktop aims to stimulate children's interest in programming and develop their problem-solving and logical thinking skills.

### 7.1 LED Blink

#### 7.1.1 Overview

LED Blink is one of the simplest entry-level programming projects. It only needs an LED and then upload the code  This simple project helps beginners better master basic concepts.

#### 7.1.2 Schematic Diagram

![6-1-2](./media/6-1-2.png)

**LED lighting on:** The output current of the IO ports is limited, so the LED brightness may not be enough. Therefore, a NPN triode (Q2) is added to the circuit as a switch. We only need to add a high(low) level at the triode base pin 1 to light it up(out).

**Triode on/off:** To put it simple, when the base(pin 1) receives a high level, the collector(pin 3) and the transmitter(pin 2) are connected, so then VCC passes through the current-limiting resistor to the LED and then into the triode to GND, forming a loop. At this time, LED is on. When pin 1 receives a low level, pin 3 and 2 are disconnected so the current loop cannot be formed, resulting LED off.

#### 7.1.3 Code Blocks

1. ![j1](./media/j1.png) 

	The start of the execution of a code. Codes will not run without this block. The module blocks that need to be initialized should be added below the block.

	Code run in here and are executing all the time (in a loop).

3. ![j3](./media/j3.png) 

	This block controls the ON/OFF of an LED. You only need to set the pin and power level(HIGH/LOW).

4. ![j4](./media/j4.png) 

	The delay seconds can be modified as needed. 

	Unit: s. 

	Some conversions: 1S=1000mS; 1mS=1000uS; For instance, if a delay of 10ms is required, input 0.01.

### 7.2 Sound Sensor

#### 7.2.1 Overview

The sound sensor, with excellent sound reception, mainly contains a high sensitivity microphone and an LM358 operational amplifier. Weak sound signals are captured by the microphone and amplified by LM358, so the output is clear and recognizable, which can be effectively detected the sounds. 

This sensor features high sensitivity, fast response speed, so is widely used in sound detection and recognition, providing a stable and reliable voice input solution for various intelligent devices.

#### 7.2.2 Schematic Diagram

![6-4-2](./media/6-2-2.png)

**Working principle:** If the built-in electret film vibrates after receiving sounds, its capacitance will change to produce a tiny voltage. The LM358 chip is adopted in circuits to amplify the sound signals detected by the high-sensitivity microphone.

#### 7.2.3 Code Blocks

### 7.5 Photoresistor

#### 7.5.1 Overview

Photoresistor is photoelectric device that works according to semiconductor photoconductivity. It can be used to sense the brightness of the current environment to output a corresponding analog value.

####  7.5.2 Schematic Diagram

![6-5](./media/6-5-2.png)

Photoresistor takes advantage of the photoelectric effect of semiconductors. Its resistance varies with ambient light. 

In the light, the semiconductor material absorbs photon energy to produce electron-hole pairs, increasing the conductivity and reducing the resistance. The brighter the light is, the lower the resistance will be. From the changes of resistance, it can sense light intensity accurately. Therefore, it is widely used in automatic lighting, photoelectric control, real-time monitoring and regulation of light.

### 7.6 AD Button

#### 7.6.1 Overview

The AD button requires only one analog pin to read multiple button states, which greatly saves IO ports. It adopts analog acquisition, and the output voltages vary from pressed buttons, so that different analog values can be obtained. We can determine which button is pressed according to these values.

####  7.6.2 Schematic Diagram

![6-6-2](./media/6-6-2.png)

From the Schematic Diagram: 

When no button is pressed, the output at signal pin IO33 is pulled down by R34 (connected to GND. So the analog value of IO33 is 0, that is, low level 0V;

When button S1(the red button) is pressed, pin IO33 is connected to VCC. So the analog value of IO33 is 4095 (voltage = 3.3V).

When button S2(the yellow button) is pressed, the voltage of IO33 is that between R32 and R34: VCCxR34/(R32+R34) ≈ 2.2V, and the analog value is about 2432;

When button S3(the green button) is pressed, the voltage of IO33 is that between R32+R33 and R34: VCCxR34/(R32+R33+R34) ≈ 1.1V, and the analog value is about 1175.

#### 7.6.3 Code Blocks

1. ![j21](./media/j21.png) 

	This block reads the analog value of AD button module and determines which button is pressed according to this value.

2. ![j7](./media/j7.png) 

	This block declares variables. Its type is int by default. You can input a Name and an Assignment(initial value).

3. ![j8](./media/j8.png) 

	This block records a value of a variable so that we can directly use it to replace the value. Before using, you only need to modify its name into the needed variable.

4. ![j9](./media/j9.png) 

	This block assigns a value to a variable. For example, we need to assign 100 to variable val, just input the variable name and value in the block accordingly. 

5. ![j22](./media/j22.png) 

	This is a comparison block that compares the values on both sides. If the left one is greater than the right one, output 1; or else, output 0.

6. ![j23](./media/j23.png) 

	Similarly, this is also a comparison block. If the left one is lower than the right one, output 1; or else, output 0.

7. ![j24](./media/j24.png) 

	This is a logical block with two condition boxes. Only when both sides output 1, this block outputs 1. One or both of the two sides output 0, and this block will output 0.

8. ![j25](./media/j25.png)

### 7.7 Ultrasonic Sensor

#### 7.7.1 Overview

Ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of an object by sound waves. It boasts a transmitter and a receiver to emit sound waves and then measure the returned waves. The time difference between transmitting and receiving can be used to calculate the distance value. Beyond that, it is also used to detect the shape or presence of objects, build automatic doors, and measure flow rates and pressures.

####  7.7.2 Schematic Diagram

**Working principle:** Like bats, the ultrasonic sensor sends an ultrasonic signal with a high frequency that human cannot hear. If these signals encounter obstacles, they will immediately reflect back and be received by the sensor. After that, the distance between the sensor and the obstacle is calculated according to the time difference between signals transmitting and receiving. 

**Maximum detection distance:** 3M

**Minimum detection distance:** 4cm

**Detection angle:** no greater than 15 degrees

### 7.12 (Direction Recognition) Geomagnetic Sensor

#### 7.12.1 Overview

AK8975C geomagnetic sensor is a three-axis electronic compass IC with high sensitivity. It can output 13-bit data and accurately detect X, Y, Z axes geomagnetic values. Thus, it is suitable for portable devices with navigation function such as mobile phones and tablets.

####  7.12.2 Schematic Diagram

![6-12](./media/6-12-2.png)

The AK8975C geomagnetic sensor works in the principle of electromagnetic induction. It takes the Earth's magnetic field as a measurement benchmark to sense changes in the magnetic field through its internal magnetic material and coils. Specifically, when the magnetic material is affected by geomagnetic field, a directional constrained electron spin deflection will happen due to the field force, which in turn forms a magnetic field. This field induces potential signals in the coil.

This sensor amplifies and processes the induced potential signals, which are then transmitted to the system for further calculation, analysis and processing. So it measures geomagnetic magnetic field in the axis X, Y, and Z to determine the direction.

### 7.14 Servo

#### 7.14.1 Overview

The 9g servo features small size but high performance and precision and is with good torque and accuracy, so it is perfect for small machines. With up to 180 degrees rotation angle, it enables extremely precise rotation and control and can be started fast with low noise.

####  7.14.2 Schematic Diagram

**Angle range:** 180°(there are 360°, 180° and 90°)

**Drive voltage:** 3.3V / 5V

Usually three wires:

![6-14](./media/6-14-2-1.png)

**GND:** grounded, in brown

**VCC:** connect to +5v (3.3V) power, in red

**S:** signal pin to control PWM signal, in orange

![6-14](./media/6-14-2-2.png)

**Control principle**: The rotation Angle of the servo is controlled by adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM (pulse width modulation) signals. Theoretically, the period of the standard PWM signal is fixed at 20ms (50Hz), so the pulse width should be 1ms ~ 2ms. But in fact, it is 0.5ms ~ 2.5ms, corresponding to the servo angle of  0° ~ 180°. Note that the angle for the same signal varies from servo brands.

#### 7.14.3 Code Blocks

1. ![j43](./media/j43.png) 

	This block controls servo angle. You only need to set a pin, channel, degree(range of 0-180) and delay(1000=1S).

In this way, ambient light can be simulated by changing LED brightness along with time. Also, breathing LED can form a colorful mini light show to construct a tranquil and warm environment.

#### 7.18.2 Working Principle

PWM controls analog output via digital means, which are able to adjust the duty cycle of the wave (a signal circularly shifting between high level and low level).

digital ports of voltage output are LOW and HIGH, which respectively correspond to 0V and 5V. Generally, we define LOW as 0 and HIGH as 1. will output 500 signals of 0 or 1 within 1s. If they are 500 “1”s, 5V will be output. Oppositely, if they are all 0s, the output will be 0V. Or if they are 010101010101…, the average output will be 2.5V. In other words, output ratio of 0 and 1 affects the voltage value. 

Honestly, it differs from real continuous output, yet the more 0 and 1 signals are output per unit time, the more accurate the control will be.

### 7.29 Car Backing Radar

#### 7.29.1 Overview

When a car is in reverse, it will alarm the distance of the obstacles behind the parking space. In this project, we build a mini car backing radar with an ultrasonic sensor for distance detection, a speaker to alarm, and a traffic light module as an indicator.

#### 7.29.2 Test Code

##### 7.29.2.1 Code Flow

![6-29-2-1](./media/6-29-2-1.png)

##### 7.29.2.2 Build Code

There are two ways to upload the code: directly open the code file we provide; or manually build blocks.

**Directly open the code file we provide:**

1. Click ![](./media/j68.png) and choose `Load from your computer`

![](./media/j67.png)

2. We have already downloaded the codes on computer desktop, so open the file and choose `7-29-parkingSensor.sb3`

**Manually build blocks:**

1. Build the two basic blocks:

![6-1-4-1-1](./media/6-1-4-1-1.png)

2. Declare a variable named *distance*

3. Assign the detected value of the ultrasonic sensor to *distance*

	![QQ_1721810318114](./media/6-23-2-2-1.png)

4. Add a ![j25](./media/j25.png) to determine the *distance*. If *distance* > 40, code blocks in it will be executed: the speaker stays quiet, the red LED is off while the green one is ON.

	![QQ_1721868975906](./media/6-29-2-2-1.png)

5. Add another ![j25](./media/j25.png). If *distance* < 40, code blocks in it will be executed: the speaker alarms, the red LED is ON while the green one is off.

	![QQ_1721870782466](./media/6-29-2-2-2.png)

### 7.30 RGB Ring Clock

#### 7.30.1 Overview

In this project, we build an informal clock with an RGB ring, whose three colors represent hour, minute and second respectively. Since the ring only boasts 12 beads, each bead is 5 seconds/minutes (60/12=5).

#### 7.30.2 Test Code

##### 7.30.2.1 Code Flow

As shown in the flowchart, we use red for hour, green for minutes, blue for seconds. When second = 60, minute adds 1, and when minute = 60, hour adds 1. 

Note that here we adopt 60/5=12 rather than 59/5=11.8, this is because the variable type is integer and the value should be divided by 5. And 60 can be perfectly divided into 12 parts.

![6-30-2-1](./media/6-30-2-1.png)

##### 7.30.2.2 Build Code

There are two ways to upload the code: directly open the code file we provide; or manually build blocks.

**Directly open the code file we provide:**

1. Click ![](./media/j68.png) and choose `Load from your computer`

![](./media/j67.png)

2. We have already downloaded the codes on computer desktop, so open the file and choose `7-30-rgbClock.sb3`

**Manually build blocks:**

1. Build the two basic blocks:![6-1-4-1-1](./media/6-1-4-1-1.png)

2. Initialize the serial port and set baud rate to 9600. 

	Initialize RGB module and declare three variables named *hour*, *minute*, *second* respectively. We assign them initial values, for example, we set the time to 10: 30: 40

![QQ_1721895321044](./media/6-30-2-2-1.png)

3. In ![QQ_1721895350840](./media/myBlocks.png), we build a function block. Click ![QQ_1721895399311](./media/6-30-2-2-2.png) to name the function. Here we name it *clockCode*, click ok.

   ![QQ_1721895561889](./media/6-30-2-2-3.png)

4. Function block: ![QQ_1721895613952](./media/6-30-2-2-4.png). Add code blocks under this block to define the function. This block is placed separately, when using, drag ![QQ_1721895716867](./media/6-30-2-2-5.png) in ![QQ_1721895350840](./media/myBlocks.png) and put it at the position as needed. 

5. Add a ![QQ_1721895820024](./media/6-30-2-2-6.png) to count seconds. Then add a ![j25](./media/j25.png) to determine whether second value is greater than 59. If yes, minute+1 and zero out second.

![QQ_1721896005372](./media/6-30-2-2-7.png)

6. Add another ![j25](./media/j25.png) to determine whether minute > 59. If yes, hour+1 and zero out minute. 

	Drag one more ![j25](./media/j25.png) and put it in the above ![j25](./media/j25.png) to determine whether hour > 12. If yes, hour = 1.

![](./media/6-30-2-2-8.png)

7. Add a delay of 1s, and print the values of hour, minute, second on serial monitor. 

![QQ_1721896392541](./media/6-30-2-2-9.png)

8. Call the function clockCode. In ![QQ_1721895350840](./media/myBlocks.png), drag ![QQ_1721895716867](./media/6-30-2-2-5.png) and place it into ![j2](./media/j2.png). 

	Till now, these are all code blocks of time counting and display. Parts below are settings of beads to light on according to time. 

9. Add ![j16](./media/j16.png) to determine whether second is 0 after dividing by 5. If second=0, current time is within 5s. So we light up the 12th beads of the RGB ring. Pay attention that add a ![j51](./media/j51.png) above. If it is not 0, light up the bead at **(second / 5) - 1**. For instance, when second=30, and 30/5-1=5, so 5th bead lights up. (We set the variable type to integer (int), so the division remainders are omitted.) Second is in BLUE.

![QQ_1721897532506](./media/6-30-2-2-10.png)

10. Similarly, set the minute. The difference is that this part is without a clear block. Minute is in GREEN.

![QQ_1721897597770](./media/6-30-2-2-11.png)

11. When setting hours, only **hour-1** without being divided by 5. Hour range 1-12h corresponds to beads 0-11. Hour is in RED. At last, add a ![j52](./media/j52.png).

**Complete Test Code**

![6-30-2-2](./media/6-30-2-2.png)

##### 7.30.2.3 Test Result

Before uploading code, you need to input an initial time in the following blocks of variables hour, minute, second. Herein, we set to 10: 30: 40.

![QQ_1721897911774](./media/6-30-2-3.png)

After uploading code, you will see the RGB ring shows the time: red for hour, green for minute, blue for second. A minute passes as blue runs a circle. 

Only one color will be displayed when they are overlapped. Blue will not cover green while green will not cover red. 

<p style="color:red;">Note that this is an informal clock without a clock chip. So its errors begin to accumulate over time.</p>

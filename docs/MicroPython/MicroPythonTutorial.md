# MicroPython Tutorial

MicroPython is a stripped-down version of Python 3 language, which includes a small portion of the Python standard library. It can run in microcontrollers and restricted environments after being optimized. Here are the main features of MicroPython:

1. **Compatibility**: MicroPython strives to be as compatible as possible with normal Python (CPython), which means that if you know Python, you already know the basics of MicroPython. 
2. **Hardware access**: In addition to core Python libraries, MicroPython includes modules such as "machines" for accessing low-level hardware, giving developers direct control over the hardware resources of the microcontroller. 
3. **Interactive prompt (REPL)**: MicroPython provides an interactive prompt (REPL) so that users execute commands directly from a desktop computer on an embedded platform. This is very useful for fast real-time testing and debugging of embedded systems. 
4. **Multi-threading support**: MicroPython firmware supports multi-threading, which enables a single microcontroller to handle multiple embedded tasks simultaneously, thus speeding up the executions.
5. **Open source project**: MicroPython is an open source project whose source code is available on Github. It follows the MIT license and is free to use for educational and commercial purposes. 
6. **Wide support**: MicroPython supports a variety of microcontroller boards and RTOS (real-time operating systems), such as ESP32, ESP8266, STM32, etc. In addition, it also provides rich libraries and modules to meet different development needs.

## 7. ESP32 Coding Box

### 7.1 LED Blink

#### 7.1.1 Overview

LED Blink is one of the simplest entry-level programming projects. It only needs an LED and then upload the code on the ESP32 Coding Box. This simple project helps beginners better master basic concepts.

#### 7.1.2 Schematic Diagram

![](./media/7-1-1.png)

**LED lighting on:** The output current of the IO ports is limited, so the LED brightness may not be enough. Therefore, a NPN triode (Q2) is added to the circuit as a switch. We only need to add a high(low) level at the triode base pin 1 to light it up(out).

**Triode on/off:** To put it simple, when the base(pin 1) receives a high level, the collector(pin 3) and the transmitter(pin 2) are connected, so then VCC passes through the current-limiting resistor to the LED and then into the triode to GND, forming a loop. At this time, LED is on. When pin 1 receives a low level, pin 3 and 2 are disconnected so the current loop cannot be formed, resulting LED off.

#### 7.1.3 Test Code

**Code:**

Open Thonny. Connect the board to computer and choose the port. In Files, open **7-1-led.py** and click ![](media/run.jpg).

```python
'''
 * Filename    : 7-1-led
 * Thonny      : Thonny 4.1.4
 * Auther      : http//www.keyestudio.com
'''
from machine import Pin
import time

led = Pin(23,Pin.OUT) 	# Set IO23 as the red LED control pin，set pin to output

while True:
    led.on()			#red led on
    time.sleep(1)		#delay 1S
    led.off()			#red led off
    time.sleep(1)		#delay 1S

```

 **Result:**

After uploading the code, red LED will blink with an interval of 1 second.

#### 7.1.4  Extension

If you want the LED to blink more frequently, just modify the delay time to 200mS. Let’s have a try!

**Code:**

Open Thonny. Connect the board to computer and choose the port. In Files, open **7-1-led2.py** and click ![](media/run.jpg).

```python
'''
 * Filename    : 7-1-led2
 * Thonny      : Thonny 4.1.4
 * Auther      : http//www.keyestudio.com
'''
from machine import Pin
import time

led = Pin(23,Pin.OUT) 	# connect the led to pin IO23, set it to output

while True:
    led.on()				#red led on
    time.sleep_ms(200)		#delay 200mS
    led.off()				#red led off
    time.sleep_ms(200)		#delay 200mS


```

**Result:**

After uploading the code, the red LED will blink with an interval of 200mS. Compared to the previous experiment, it blinks more frequently.

#### 7.1.5 Code Explanation

1. `from machine import Pin`

   Import Pin from machine to enable its functions.

   **machine.Pin**

   ```python
   machine.Pin(id,mode,pull,value)
   ```

   id ：ESP32 GPIO pin number. For example, if you enable GPIO23, fill in with 23.

   mode ：pin mode can be one of the followings:

   ​	Pin.IN(0) - set pin to input

   ​	Pin.OUT(1) - set pin to (normal)output

   ​	Pin.OPEN_DRAIN(2) - set pin to open drain output

   pull ：specifies whether the pin is connected to a (weak-)pull resistor; it is valid only at input mode, and can be one of the followings:

   ​	None - no pull-up/down

   ​	Pin.PULL_UP(1) - enable pull-up resistor

   ​	Pin.PULL_DOWN(2) - enable pull-down resistor

   value ：only work at Pin.OUT and Pin.OPEN_DRAIN mode; assign the initial output pin value. Or else, the peripheral state of the pin stays still. 0 is low(off) while 1 is high(on).

   Pin.on() - set pin to high

   Pin.off() - set pin to low

2. `import time`

   Import **time** type so that its related functions can be adopted.

3. `led = Pin23, Pin.OUT)`

	connect LED to pin io23, set pin to output.

Q ：Why "output"?

A ：The code is written for the mainboard. For the board, pin io23 is outputting power levels (high or low) to the connected module.

4. `while True:`

   Statements in this function will execute in a loop.

   Formula of while loop function:

```python
while (condition)：
    (statements)……
```

5. `led.on()` and `led.off()`

   At pin io23 on the mainboard, respectively output high(1) and low(0); i.e., output high(1)/low(0) to LED module to make it on/off.

6. `time.sleep(1)` 

   Delay 1s.

   `time.sleep_ms`(1)

   Delay 1ms, this is more common.

   `time.sleep_us`(1)

   Delay 1us, this is a underlying code which is not commonly used.

   Conversion: 1s = 1000ms, 1ms = 1000us

   Q ：Why delay?

   A ：If you output a high level to LED, it will be always on. Yet, we add a delay of 1s, so it lights up for only 1s. Delay time is the ON/OFF time of LED.



### 7.2 Sound Sensor

#### 7.2.1 Overview

The sound sensor, with excellent sound reception, mainly contains a high sensitivity microphone and an LM358 operational amplifier. Weak sound signals are captured by the microphone and amplified by LM358, so the output is clear and recognizable, which can be effectively detected the sounds. 

This sensor features high sensitivity, fast response speed, so is widely used in sound detection and recognition, providing a stable and reliable voice input solution for various intelligent devices.

#### 7.2.2 Schematic Diagram

![6-4-2](./media/6-2-2.png)

**Working principle:** If the built-in electret film vibrates after receiving sounds, its capacitance will change to produce a tiny voltage. The LM358 chip is adopted in circuits to amplify the sound signals detected by the high-sensitivity microphone.

#### 7.2.3 Test Code

In Files, open **7-2-sound.py** and click ![](media/run.jpg).

 **Code:**

```python
'''
 * Filename    : 7-2-sound
 * Thonny      : Thonny 4.1.4
 * Auther      : http//www.keyestudio.com
'''
# Import Pin, ADC and DAC modules.
from machine import ADC,Pin
import time

adc=ADC(Pin(34))			#set pin GPIO 34 as ADC input pin
adc.atten(ADC.ATTN_11DB)	#voltage range 0-3.3V
adc.width(ADC.WIDTH_12BIT)	#set ADC resolution

# Read ADC value once every 0.1seconds, convert ADC value to DAC value and output it, and print these data to “Shell”.
while True:	
        adcVal = adc.read()				#read the analog value of the sound sensor and assign it to variable to adcVal
        print("Sonoro ADC Val:",adcVal) #serial monitor prints adcVal value
        time.sleep_ms(50)					#delay 50mS

```

**Result:**

Click ![img](./media/run.jpg)“Run current script” to run the code. “Shell” displays the ADC value of the sensor. Press “Ctrl+C” or click ![img](./media/stop.jpg)“Stop/Restart backend” to quit the execution.

![QQ_1722332795073](./media/QQ_1722332795073.png)

#### 7.2.4 Code Explanation

1. **`adc = ADC(Pin(34))`**:

   create an ADC object and set pin GPIO 34 to input. `Pin(34)` assigns a pin, `ADC(Pin(34))` means pin GPIO 34 is the input pin of ADC.

2. **`adc.atten(ADC.ATTN_11DB)`**:

   set the Attenuation class of ADC. Attenuation expands the voltage range of ADC. `ADC.ATTN_11DB` is an optional setting of ESP32, which expands the voltage range to 0-3.6V. ADC of ESP32 supports different attenuation settings:

   - `ADC.ATTN_0DB`：input voltage range 0-1V
   - `ADC.ATTN_2_5DB`：input voltage range 0-1.34V
   - `ADC.ATTN_6DB`：input voltage range 0-2V
   - `ADC.ATTN_11DB`：input voltage range 0-3.3V

   Setting attenuation helps you accurately read analog signals across different voltage ranges.

3. **`adc.width(ADC.WIDTH_12BIT)`**:

   Set ADC resolution to 12 bit. ADC of ESP32 can be configured different resolutions:

   - `ADC.WIDTH_9BIT`：resolution of 9 bit
   - `ADC.WIDTH_10BIT`：resolution of 10 bit
   - `ADC.WIDTH_11BIT`：resolution of 11 bit
   - `ADC.WIDTH_12BIT`：resolution of 12 bit

   The 12-bit resolution means that the ADC can subdivide the input voltage into 2^12^ = 4096 levels, which can provide finer measurements.

4. `print("Sonoro ADC Val:",adcVal)` prints characters in double quotes and the value of the variable adcVal. Line wrap after printing.



### 7.3 PIR Motion Sensor

#### 7.3.1 Overview

The PIR motion sensor adopts RE200B-P element. 

Based on pyroelectric effect, the sensor is able to detect the infrared ray emitted by human body or animal. With Fresnel lens, it can even detect farther and wider. When a nearby human or animal motion is detected, the sensor outputs a high level.

####  7.3.2 Schematic Diagram

![6-3](./media/6-3-2.png)

**Working principle:** The human body maintains at 37 degrees, so it will emit a specific wavelength of about 10μm infrared. The sensor captures 10μM infrared to determine whether there is a motion.

#### 7.3.3 Test Code

 **Code:**

In Files, open **7-3-pir.py** and click ![](media/run.jpg).

```python
'''
 * Filename    : 7-3-pir
 * Thonny      : Thonny 4.1.4
 * Auther      : http//www.keyestudio.com
'''
from machine import Pin
import time

PIR = Pin(19, Pin.IN)  # set pin IO19 to the pir input pin
while True:
    PIR_value = PIR.value()	#read Pir sensor value and assign it to variable value
    print(PIR_value, end = " ") #print PIR_value without wrapping
    if PIR_value == 1:		#determine whether PIR_value = 1
        print("Some body is in this area!")#if PIR_value = 1, execute the code
    else:	#or else
        print("No one!")
    time.sleep(0.1)	#delay 0.1S(100ms)

```

**Result:**

Click ![img](./media/run.jpg)“Run current script” to run the code. “Shell” prints the corresponding value and characters. When a motion is detected, value = 1,  and “shell” shows “1 Somebody is in this area!” If no motion is detected, value = 0, “shell” prints “0 No one!”

Press “Ctrl+C” or click ![img](./media/stop.jpg)“Stop/Restart backend” to quit the execution.

![QQ_1722333497036](./media/QQ_1722333497036.png)

#### 7.3.4 Code Explanation

1. `if-else` determines PIR sensor state. Different contents will be printed according to its state.

- （if）`PIR_value == 1`: an object or a motion is detected, “Some body is in this area!” is printed.
- （else）`PIR_value` ≠ 1(PIR_value = 0): “No one!” is printed.

2. `print(PIR_value, end = " ")`：Print `PIR_value` without wrapping. `end=" "` means no wrap and ends with a space to continuously display changes in sensor status on the same line. 



### 7.4 Power Amplifier

#### 7.4.1 Overview

The 8002b power amplifier mainly consists of a speaker and an audio amplification chip. It can amplify small audio signals for about 8.5 times. These amplified sounds will be played through its speaker. Besides, it can also play some music or melodies. 

####  7.4.2 Schematic Diagram

![6-4](./media/6-4-2.png)

The power amplifier is enabled by square wave. The square wave can be changed by the duty cycle of PWM.

- The greater the duty cycle is, the louder the sound will be.

Or the tone can be adjusted via the frequency of PWM:

- The higher the frequency is, the higher the tone will be.

**What is PWM?**

PWM (Pulse width modulation) is a scheme that simulates the change of analog signals by digital signal.

Pulse width is the high level part in a complete square wave cycle. Therefore, PWM is a modulation of high level. Of course, in other words, the cycle is fixed, so it adjust the low level part as well. 

![3402](./media/7-4-2.png)

- **PWM frequency**

  Frequency is the number of times the signal goes from high to low level and back to high in 1 second (this is one cycle), that is, how many cycles there are in a second PWM.

  Unit: Hz

  Expression: 50Hz; 100Hz

- **PWM cycle**

  $ T= \frac {1}{f}$      $ Cycle = \frac {1}{Frequency}$

  When frequency is 50Hz, i.e., the cycle is 20ms, there are 50 PWM cycles within 1s.

- **PWM duty cycle**

  Duty cycle is the ratio of the time of the high level to the that of the whole cycle in a cycle.

  - Unit: % (1% ~ 100%)


  - **Cycle**: The time of a pulse signal. Frequency is the number cycles in 1s.
  - **Pulse width time**: high level time.

  ![3403](./media/7-4-3.gif)

  <center>The Relationship between Duty Cycle and LED Brightness.gif<center>

#### 7.4.4 Code Explanation

1. `from machine import Pin, PWM`

   import PWM function.

    **machine.PWM**

   `machine.PWM(pin)`：PWM object constructor, it reinitializes the specified GPIO and sets to PWM output.

   ​	pin: GPIO object that needs to be set to PWM output.

   `PWM.freq（value）`：set PWM output frequency.

   ​	value : PWM output frequency. The value should conform to the PWM frequency calculation formula.

   `PWM.duty（value）`：set duty cycle. The corresponding value is calculated automatically through value.

   ​	value: set duty cycle ratio, within 

2. `trumpet = PWM(Pin(32) ,freq=5000, duty=128)` 

   `Pin(32)`：set pin GPIO32 to output PWM

   `freq=5000`：set PWM frequency to 5000 Hz

   `duty=128`：at 8 bit resolution, set PWM duty cycle to 128, corresponding to 50%. Duty cycle range: 0-255

3. `a = [523,587,659,698,784,880,988]`

   In python, [ ] means a list, elements in which are separated with comma.

   Create a list “a”, elements: 523, 587, 659, 698, 784, 880, 988, corresponds to tone C, D, E, F, G, A, B.

4. ```python
   for i in a:
   	trumpet.duty(10) #tone at duty cycle of 10, sound decrease
       trumpet.freq(i)
       time.sleep(0.5)
   ```

   **for statement** in Python: play tone at duty cycle of 10, each tone for 0.5s.

   In Python, for loop is an iteration statement, which is used for loop of a traversal list (including strings, lists, elements, dictionaries, collections) or executes a loop a specified number of times. 

   Grammatical structure of for loop:
   
   ```python
   for iterating_var in sequence:
      statements(s)
   ```

   Flow of for statement:

   ![3406](./media/7-4-5.png)

   traversal string:
   
   ```python
   # define string name
   hopy = "reaipaobu"
   # for loop processes string
   for x in hopy: 
          print(x)
   ```

   Results:
   
   ```
   r
   e
   a
   i
   p
   a
   o
   b
   u
   ```
   
   As you can see, for loop takes the contents of the string in turn. So it is also called traversal loop.



### 7.5 Photoresistor

#### 7.5.1 Overview

Photoresistor is photoelectric device that works according to semiconductor photoconductivity. It can be used to sense the brightness of the current environment to output a corresponding analog value.

####  7.5.2 Schematic Diagram

![6-5](./media/6-5-2.png)

Photoresistor takes advantage of the photoelectric effect of semiconductors. Its resistance varies with ambient light. 

In the light, the semiconductor material absorbs photon energy to produce electron-hole pairs, increasing the conductivity and reducing the resistance. The brighter the light is, the lower the resistance will be. From the changes of resistance, it can sense light intensity accurately. Therefore, it is widely used in automatic lighting, photoelectric control, real-time monitoring and regulation of light.

### 7.6 AD Button

#### 7.6.1 Overview

The AD button requires only one analog pin to read multiple button states, which greatly saves IO ports. It adopts analog acquisition, and the output voltages vary from pressed buttons, so that different analog values can be obtained. We can determine which button is pressed according to these values.

####  7.6.2 Schematic Diagram

![6-6-2](./media/6-6-2.png)

From the Schematic Diagram: 

When no button is pressed, the output at signal pin IO33 is pulled down by R34 (connected to GND. So the analog value of IO33 is 0, that is, low level 0V;

When button S1(the red button) is pressed, pin IO33 is connected to VCC. So the analog value of IO33 is 4095 (voltage = 3.3V).

When button S2(the yellow button) is pressed, the voltage of IO33 is that between R32 and R34: VCCxR34/(R32+R34) ≈ 2.2V, and the analog value is about 2432;

When button S3(the green button) is pressed, the voltage of IO33 is that between R32+R33 and R34: VCCxR34/(R32+R33+R34) ≈ 1.1V, and the analog value is about 1175.

### 7.7 Ultrasonic Sensor

#### 7.7.1 Overview

Ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of an object by sound waves. It boasts a transmitter and a receiver to emit sound waves and then measure the returned waves. The time difference between transmitting and receiving can be used to calculate the distance value. Beyond that, it is also used to detect the shape or presence of objects, build automatic doors, and measure flow rates and pressures.

### 7.12 (Direction Recognition) Geomagnetic Sensor

#### 7.12.1 Overview

AK8975C geomagnetic sensor is a three-axis electronic compass IC with high sensitivity. It can output 13-bit data and accurately detect X, Y, Z axes geomagnetic values. Thus, it is suitable for portable devices with navigation function such as mobile phones and tablets.

####  7.12.2 Schematic Diagram

![6-12](./media/6-12-2.png)

The AK8975C geomagnetic sensor works in the principle of electromagnetic induction. It takes the Earth's magnetic field as a measurement benchmark to sense changes in the magnetic field through its internal magnetic material and coils. Specifically, when the magnetic material is affected by geomagnetic field, a directional constrained electron spin deflection will happen due to the field force, which in turn forms a magnetic field. This field induces potential signals in the coil.

This sensor amplifies and processes the induced potential signals, which are then transmitted to the system for further calculation, analysis and processing. So it measures geomagnetic magnetic field in the axis X, Y, and Z to determine the direction.

### 7.13 Fan/Motor Module

#### 7.13.1 Overview

The motor adopts HR1124S motor control chip that is a single channel H-bridge driver chip used in DC motors. The H-bridge drive uses PMOS and NMOS power tubes with low on-resistance, ensuring lower power loss and longer safe working time. In addition, its standby and static working current are both low, so it is commonly used in toys.

### 7.14 Servo

#### 7.14.1 Overview

The 9g servo features small size but high performance and precision and is with good torque and accuracy, so it is perfect for small machines. With up to 180 degrees rotation angle, it enables extremely precise rotation and control and can be started fast with low noise.

####  7.14.2 Schematic Diagram

**Angle range:** 180°(there are 360°, 180° and 90°)

**Drive voltage:** 3.3V / 5V

Usually three wires:

![6-14](./media/7-14-1.png)

**GND:** grounded, in brown

**VCC:** connect to +5v (3.3V) power, in red

**S:** signal pin to control PWM signal, in orange

![6-14](./media/7-14-2.png)

**Control principle**: The rotation Angle of the servo is controlled by adjusting the duty cycle of the PWM (pulse width modulation) signals. Theoretically, the period of the standard PWM signal is fixed at 20ms (50Hz), so the pulse width should be 1ms ~ 2ms. But in fact, it is 0.5ms ~ 2.5ms, corresponding to the servo angle of  0° ~ 180°. Note that the angle for the same signal varies from servo brands.

#### 7.14.4 Test Code

Open **7-14-servo.py** 

Before uploading code, library is required. In lib file, open **servo.py**, and choose *Upload to /*.

    servo.set_angle(90)  # rotate servo to 90 degree
    time.sleep(1)
    servo.set_angle(180)  # rotate servo to 180 degree
    time.sleep(1)


```

**Result:**

After uploading code, the servo rotates to 0 degree, 90 degree and 180 degree accordingly, with each position staying for 1 second, and then it back to 0 degree. It repeats these rotations.

#### 7.14.5 Extension

servo = Servo(pin=25)  # connect servo to pin

while True:
    #rotate servo from 0 degree to 180 degree
    for angle in range(0,180):
        servo.set_angle(angle)  # rotate servo to 180 degree
        time.sleep_ms(10)		# delay 10ms
    #rotate servo from 180 degree to 0 degree
    for angle in range(180,-1,-1):
        servo.set_angle(angle)  # rotate servo to 0 degree
        time.sleep_ms(10)



```

**Result:**

After uploading code, the servo repeatedly and gradually rotates from 0 degree to 180 degree and then gradually back to 0 degree.

#### 7.14.6 Code Explanation

1. `for angle in range(0,180):`

   This `for` loop traverses all integers from 0 to 179,

   `range(0,180)` generates a sequence containing 0 but not 180.

2. `for angle in range(180,-1,-1):`

	This `for` loop is similar to the above one but in reverse order, i.e., all integers from 180 to 0. 

	In `range(180,-1,-1)`, -1 means step = -1. So this loop traverses elements from large to small.

### 7.18 Breathing LED

#### 7.18.1 Overview

PWM breathing LED utilizes on-board programmable PWM to output analog waveform. After powering on, LED brightness can be adjusted through duty cycle of the waveform to eventually realize a breathing light.

In this way, ambient light can be simulated by changing LED brightness along with time. Also, breathing LED can form a colorful mini light show to construct a tranquil and warm environment.

#### 7.18.2 Working Principle

PWM controls analog output via digital means, which are able to adjust the duty cycle of the wave (a signal circularly shifting between high level and low level).

digital ports of voltage output are LOW and HIGH, which respectively correspond to 0V and 5V. Generally, we define LOW as 0 and HIGH as 1. will output 500 signals of 0 or 1 within 1s. If they are 500 “1”s, 5V will be output. Oppositely, if they are all 0s, the output will be 0V. Or if they are 010101010101…, the average output will be 2.5V. In other words, output ratio of 0 and 1 affects the voltage value. 

Honestly, it differs from real continuous output, yet the more 0 and 1 signals are output per unit time, the more accurate the control will be.

### 7.27 Auto-fan

#### 7.27.1 Overview

The weather is getting hotter in summer, so some public places will be equipped with some auto-fans that sense the ambient temperature value. When the temperature reaches a set value, he fan turns on. We add a PIR motion sensor to lower energy consumption. Thus, the fan will turn on only when the temperature reaches the value and someone is sensed nearby. 

Now let's do it!

### 7.30 RGB Ring Clock

#### 7.30.1 Overview

In this project, we build an informal clock with an RGB ring, whose three colors represent hour, minute and second respectively. Since the ring only boasts 12 beads, each bead is 5 seconds/minutes (60/12=5).

#### 7.30.2 Test Code

 **Code Flow:**

As shown in the flowchart, we use red for hour, green for minutes, blue for seconds. When second = 60, minute adds 1, and when minute = 60, hour adds 1. 

Note that here we adopt 60/5=12 rather than 59/5=11.8, this is because the variable type is integer and the value should be divided by 5. And 60 can be perfectly divided into 12 parts.

Only one color will be displayed when they are overlapped. Blue will not cover green while green will not cover red. 

<p style="color:red;">Note that this is an informal clock without a clock chip. So its errors begin to accumulate over time.</p>

**Result:**

After uploading code, the arrow on the OLED will nearly point to the South. Move the coding box and you will see the direction changes. 



### 7.34 WiFi

#### 7.34.1 Overview

ESP32 boasts a built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth nodule that is widely used in Internet of Things (IoT). With this function, it can remotely control the data transmission through the wireless network. 

In applications, ESP32 can be used as a client to connect to a Wi-Fi network, or as a hotspot to create its own network. Through these connections, ESP32 receives commands to control external devices, such as turning on/off lights and adjusting temperature. In the code, protocols like HTTP and MQTT are used to communicate with the server to achieve data sending and receiving, so as to remotely control and monitoring.

#### 7.34.2 ESP32 WiFi Introduction

ESP32 development board comes with built-in Wi-Fi (2.4G) and Bluetooth (4.2), which enable it to easily connect to Wi-Fi network and communicate with other devices in the network. You can display web pages in your browser via ESP32.

![6-34](./media/6-34-3-1.png)

- Base station mode (STA / Wi-Fi Client mode): ESP32 is connected to Wi-Fi hotspot (AP).
- AP mode (Soft-AP / Wi-Fi hotspot mode): Wi-Fi device(s) is(are) connected to ESP32.
- AP-STA mode: ESP32 is both Wi-Fi hotspot and a Wi-Fi device connected to another Wi-Fi.
- These modes supports multiple security modes, including WPA, WPA2 and WEP.
- It is able to scan Wi-Fi hotspot (active or passive)
- It support promiscuous mode monitoring IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi packets.

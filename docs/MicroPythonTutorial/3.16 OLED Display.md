# 3.16 OLED Display

## 3.16.1 Overview

OLED display is also called organic light-emitting diode or organic dot laser display. This display is self-luminous. It adopts a very thin coating of organic materials and glass substrate which will light up if current passes through. Therefore, it does not require a back-light. Note that it will not light up when just powering on; programing and wiring are also needed.

Besides, it features large viewing Angle, low power consumption, high contrast, thin display, fast response, simple structure, and can work on flexion boards within a wide temperature range.

 * Filename    : 3-16-oled
 * Thonny      : Thonny 4.1.4
 * Auther      : http//www.keyestudio.com
-----------------------------------------
oled.clear()
clear display. If you want to display new content, you have to clear the last display; or the two content will be overlapped

oled.oled.show()
refresh to display the new content on OLED

oled.show_text("******", X,Y)
set code. input content to be displayed in the double quotation marks,
and set value of Xï¼ŒY to control the starting position of the display.
'''
import machine
from oled import OLED

# Initialize I2C interface
i2c = machine.SoftI2C(scl=machine.Pin(22), sda=machine.Pin(21))

# create OLED example
oled = OLED(i2c)

# clear display
oled.clear()

# show text
oled.show_text("KEYESTUTDIO", 20, 0)

# show text
oled.show_text("Hello World!", 20, 10)
oled.show_text("MicroPython", 20, 20)

# show
oled.oled.show()

```

**Result:**

After uploading code, you will see the OLED shows the text you set. On the first line, "KEYESTUTDIO" is displayed; "Hello World!" shows on the second line and "MicroPython" is on the third.
